Explaination : 
n = len(digits)

Get the length of the digits array.

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)

Loop through the array from right to left (starting from the last digit).

if digits[i] < 9:

If the current digit is less than 9, simply add 1 to it and return the updated list.

digits[i] = 0

If the current digit is 9, set it to 0 and continue the loop.

This handles cases like [9, 9, 9] → [0, 0, 0] → which later becomes [1, 0, 0, 0].

Edge case: all digits are 9

After the loop, if all digits were 9 (e.g., 999 → 1000), add 1 at the front of the list.
