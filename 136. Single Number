🛠️ Simple Explanation of the Code
a = 0

Creates a variable a and initializes it with 0.

This will be used to store the result.

for x in nums:

Loops through each element x in the list nums.

a ^= x

This is a bitwise XOR operation.

XOR (^) works like this:

a ^ a = 0 → Any number XORed with itself becomes 0.

a ^ 0 = a → Any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged.

XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order doesn’t matter.

return a

After looping through all the numbers, the variable a will hold the single number (the one that appears only once).

nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]

# Iteration 1: a = 0 ^ 4 → a = 4
# Iteration 2: a = 4 ^ 1 → a = 5
# Iteration 3: a = 5 ^ 2 → a = 7
# Iteration 4: a = 7 ^ 1 → a = 6
# Iteration 5: a = 6 ^ 2 → a = 4

# Final result: 4 (the single number)
