Code: 
    class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        h = set() 
        for num in nums:
            if num in h:
                return True
            else:
                h.add(num)
        return False

🛠️ Simple Explanation of the Code
h = set()

Creates an empty set called h to store unique numbers.

Sets automatically prevent duplicates.

for num in nums:

Loops through each element num in the list nums.

if num in h:

Checks if the current number num is already in the set.

If it is, that means it's a duplicate → return True immediately.

else: h.add(num)

If the number is not in the set, add it to the set.

return False

After the loop, if no duplicates are found, return False.

✅ Example Execution
python
Copy
Edit
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]

# Iteration 1: num = 1 → not in h → add to h → h = {1}
# Iteration 2: num = 2 → not in h → add to h → h = {1, 2}
# Iteration 3: num = 3 → not in h → add to h → h = {1, 2, 3}
# Iteration 4: num = 4 → not in h → add to h → h = {1, 2, 3, 4}
# Iteration 5: num = 2 → already in h → return True (duplicate found)
